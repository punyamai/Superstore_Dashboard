### This dashboard is designed to provide insights into Superstore data. It features a user-friendly interface with drop-down menus for selecting years to visualize the data. The dashboard includes visualizations such as a bar chart of sales by category, sales by sub-category, profits by sub-category, sales by state, and sales and profit trends. Additionally, scorecards display the profits, sales, and customers in the selected year.
